	description "Leroo Station is a pirate station in the Illumina Regions. It serves as some kind of governing building for organized pirate activity. Due to it's size, pirate fleets often use this as a staging point to launch attacks on northwestern traders and occasionally the Deep. The Republic and the Deep remain baffled as to how pirates were able to obtain a large ammount of Bactrians."
	spaceport "At the docking bays, people give you weird looks, most of them being pirates. It's also possible to buy whatever you want for the right price, but this station has no stores selling slaves."

Due to this, the residents have been discussing changing the name of the system lately but it is unlikely the Republic will approve of this."
	spaceport "Most dockworkers you see at the port have been continually annoyed at constant cargo arrivals bound for Illumina. Annoyed dockworkers aside, merchants haggle for hours on end with sellers to get the lowest possible price. In addition, Markaai is home to a large ship refurbishment company, offering various types of ships for anyone's needs."

The streets of it's largest city, Laadecki is bustling with small businesses strewn across the cityscape with the occasional chop-shop. The slave trade has proliferated deep within the planet's mantle. Amongst the inhabitants, there is rumor that deep in the nearby uninhabited systems lies an entrance to an alien civillization. No explorer has been daring enough to investigate this, and it is often dismissed as mere nonsense. Due to the large shipyards here, it is a popular stopping point for captains who wish to purchase new ships or upgrades. 3"
	spaceport "The spaceport is busy with ships docking and undocking constantly. Air traffic controllers continue to exist, but ever since spacecraft made atmospheric-based vehicles obsolete, their main responsibility is now to control the flow of ships into the system."

	description "Yinachr is a densely settled desert planet home to around 3.81 billion people. You are at one of the more sparse parts of the planet where the spaceport happens to be. The buildings of this part of Yinachr seem to match the color of the sand. Large deposits of important ship-building materials lie deep beneath the surface of Yinachr. In light of this, there are many mining operations on this planet and most of the residents here are either miners or their families, with the exception of the occasional rich person who you assume is one of the supervisors. Another part of the planet that seems to trigger you is the immense temperature differences between day and night (59 & -77 C respectively)."
	spaceport "At the spaceport, which is quite small for the planet's size, is overcrowded and extremely hot to the point where you would want to wear your temperature-controlled environment suit. At one section of the spaceport, there seems to be construction work going on which you hope is a temperature control system for the whole place."

The largest settlement on Pedinai is home to the spaceport and hosts most of the planet's population of 14 million. The planet is home to a large lumber industry, supplying lumber to most of human space to provide the Paradise Planets and anyone with the right ammount of money with wooden furniture."
	spaceport "Merchant ships often stop by the area to purchase large ammounts of lumber to sell to the Paradise Planets. Most of the dockworker's equipment seem to be specialized for carrying wood, and only wood. At least one section of the spaceport is made out of wood, from what you could discern when you landed."

You do wonder why the Republic has not taken any action regarding this battle, considering their role as a peacekeeping organization. You're in one of the few spaceport complexes open to the general public, but even here you can still purchase a few ships and some decent outfits."
	spaceport "The spaceport is full of ships decked out in the livery of the Sayari Plushie Authority, but you can see a few merchant ships, if any. Most of the SPA officers ignore you, as they mind their own business trying to command the fleets of the Sayari Protection Fleet,the SPA's naval wing, which reportedly consists of 3-6,000 capital ships, far outnumbering the Republic Navy."

Even far away from the spaceport, you can hear the noise of repulsor engines and ships as they make their way out of the atmosphere into orbit, and eventually to be destroyed in battle against the CSSF."
	spaceport "The spaceport is so loud that you were stopped and boarded by a SPA ship, during which you and your crew were all instructed to wear ear protection before coming this close to the spaceport. The officer claimed that the spaceport noise levels can go as high as 120 decibels. The spaceport is designed with extensive soundproofing, such as unusually thick walls, special frequency emitters to cancel out ship sound waves, and traffic limits. Thankfully, the situation seems to be slowly improving here."

The smog on this planet is so intense that there are scrubber ships flying across the atmosphere trying to capture any smog and filter it into oxygen. Lately, many manufacturing processes have moved into orbit to fix this, but due to the fear of micrometeorites, this process has been relatively slow."
